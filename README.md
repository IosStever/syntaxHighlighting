# syntaxHighlighting

This can be used as a template for web pages that include code. The prism.css and prism.js files are the ones I created from [PrismJS](https://PrismJS.com). I chose CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Python, C#, Swift and many other languages.  I also chose customizations like the "copy" button and normalize whitespace. It's easy to go to [PrismJS](https://PrismJS.com) and customize your own files if the ones here are missing languages or features you need (of if you want a different overall theme).

I also have CDN links to Bootstrap 5.2 and I do a modern CSS reset in styles.css.

I left index.html with one example of the tags and classes needed for the highlighting.

Recommendation: Set up a snippet to create these tags for the language you're commenting on.

Cheers,

Steve
